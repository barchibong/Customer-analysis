A successful online grocery store, functioning via an app, has shown strong sales figures. However, there's a keen interest among stakeholders to delve deeper into their sales data. Specifically, they're focused on understanding the diversity of their customer base and their purchasing patterns. My role involved conducting an initial exploratory analysis of a portion of their data to extract insights and propose improved segmentation strategies.

I employed Python along with various data manipulation techniques like wrangling, merging, and deriving variables to perform this analysis. Tasks included grouping and aggregating data to uncover patterns, with subsequent reporting conducted in Excel. Additionally, I explored population flows within the dataset to gain a comprehensive understanding of customer behaviors.
